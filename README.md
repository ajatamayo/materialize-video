# materialize-video
Wordpress Plugin: Display videos as Materialize Cards. Captions will be shown as card contents if specified.

Cards are a convenient means of displaying content composed of different types of objects. Theyâ€™re also well-suited for presenting similar objects whose size or supported actions can vary considerably, like photos with captions of variable length.

When the `video` shortcode is used, the video will be displayed as a Materialize Card Image as specified here http://next.materializecss.com/cards.html.
